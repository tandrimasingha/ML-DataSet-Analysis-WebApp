### Overview Of the Web App :

A Simple EDA App for full Analysis of ML Dataset. The user need to Upload any dataset in CSV format, it will show the full analysis of the dataset such as top 5 columns, the shape, Value count, summary as well as the visualization which contains HeatMap, Pie Chat, Plot of value count. You can also see the Customizable Plot such as bar plot, kde , box plot, line plot, hist, area. The user can choose the parameters that is the x-axis and y-axis on which they want to see the plot. This web app gives you a clear overview of any dataset Of ML.
